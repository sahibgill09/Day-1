# My Experience @ GNDEC

# Day 1
As I missed my Induction ceremony due to some health issues, my first day began with an inability to locate my classroom. 
Soon, I found the correct way to my class which had already begun and the first every lecture in my life in GNDEC was of P2P and two of our brilliant seniors esplained us the basics of C++ coding. 
We learned the difference between Algorithms, Pseudocodes and Flow Charts. 
The next lecture was of English and we introduced ourself to the teacher and learned about the syllabus and schedules of the subjects.

# Day 2
The second day was much similar to the first one and I attended my first ever BEEE lecture and were introduced to the subject by our Professor.
Later, We attended the Chemistry lecture and the Ma'am explained us all about the examination system of the college and reminded us of the concepts we learned in our school regarding the subject.
